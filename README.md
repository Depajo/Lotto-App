# Lotto-App
My own Lotto Application made during introduction to Programming

I did Lotto Application that Application tell how many years you must play lotto before you get seven numbers correctly hit. I did this application in rudimentary that means I don’t used ArrayList or Set classes. I didn’t use also already exist Java classes. I created myself own classes whom I uses.
