## How to start using
Downlad src folder and go to commandline to src folder and then run
`javac fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main.java` and `java fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main` or you can put for example seven numbers to commandline like this `java fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`
