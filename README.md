# Lotto-App
My own Lotto Application made during introduction to Programming

# About the Programming

I did Lotto Application that Application tells how many years you must play lotto before you get seven numbers correctly. I did this application in rudimentary that means I didn’t use ArrayList or Set classes. I didn’t use also already existing Java classes. I created own classes by myself that i use.
