# Lotto-App
My own Lotto Application made during introduction to Programming

## About the Programming

I made Lotto Application that tells how many years you must play lotto before you get seven numbers correctly. I did this application in rudimentary that means I didn’t use ArrayList or Set classes. I didn’t use also already existing Java classes. I created own classes by myself that i use.

## Features

Write seven numbers to Lotto Application. You can enter numbers one by one or all number to commandline. If you change in `Main.java` variable `Static final int LOTTO_NUMBER_COUNT`value, then the number of numbers to be draw change and also you can change the range of drawn numbers by changing the value of the variable `static final int BIGGEST_LOTTO_NUMBERS`

## How to start using
Downlad Lotto-App folder and open commandline and go to src folder. Then you have to run
`javac fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main.java` and `java fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main` or you can put for example seven numbers to commandline like this `java fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`
