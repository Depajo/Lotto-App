# Lotto-App
My own Lotto Application made during introduction to Programming

## About the Programming

I made Lotto Application that tells how many years you must play lotto before you get seven numbers correctly. I did this application in rudimentary that means I didn’t use ArrayList or Set classes. I didn’t use also already existing Java classes. I created own classes by myself that i use.

## How to use

Write seven numbers to Lotto Application. You can enter numbers one by one or all number to commandline.
For example:
Go to src folder and then
´javac fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main.java´
´java fi/tuni/tamk/tiko/depascalejoonatan/Main´
